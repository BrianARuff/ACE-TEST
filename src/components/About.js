                    Childhood experiences, both positive and negative, have a
                    tremendous impact on future violence victimization and
                    perpetration, and lifelong health and opportunity. As such,
                    early experiences are an important public health issue. Much
                    of the foundational research in this area has been referred
                    to as Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).
